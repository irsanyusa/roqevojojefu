If you love any Anthem Ayn Rand quotes, then you will appreciate these love quotes. You can actually learn a lot from Fountainhead quotes.</p><ul><li>Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a person's sexual choice is the result and sum of their fundamental convictions. Tell me what a person finds sexually attractive and I will tell you their entire philosophy of life. Show me the person they sleep with and I will tell you their valuation of themselves. No matter what corruption they're taught about the virtue of selflessness, sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which they cannot perform for any motive but their own enjoyment - just try to think of performing it in a spirit of selfless charity! - an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exultation, only on the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire. It is an act that forces them to stand naked in spirit, as well as in body, and accept their real ego as their standard of value. They will always be attracted to the person who reflects their deepest vision of themselves — the person whose surrender permits them to experience - or to fake - a sense of self-esteem. Love is our response to our highest values - and can be nothing else.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4026259ac41a6079.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Eckhart Tolle quotes of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Do not confuse love with sexual choices. The two cannot be any different. While love is selfless, sex, in most cases is not.</p><ul><li>To say "I love you" one must know first how to say the "I".</li></ul><p class=align-left>Loving others can only stem from loving oneself. Until someone is able to love themselves, it is impossible to share that love with others. After all, you only give what you have in excess.</p><ul><li>I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Life is interesting and should only be lived for one's sake. Do not forsake yourself for others.</p><ul><li>Love is the expression of one’s values.</li></ul><p class=align-left>True love can only be seen by how much one values themselves.</p><h3>Ayn Rand atlas shrugged quotes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0c38bfa7b8ebf2f9.jpg><p class=align-left>Having been a great author, you will probably notice a few of her sayings and even have a favorite Atlas Shrugged quote.

You have been called arrogant for your independent mind. You have been called cruel for your unyielding integrity. You have been called anti-social for the vision that made you venture upon undiscovered roads.</li><li>I refuse to apologize for my ability—I refuse to apologize for my success—I refuse to apologize for my money.</li><li>We are on strike against martyrdom—and against the moral code that demands it. We are on strike against those who believe that one man must exist for the sake of another. We are on strike against the morality of cannibals, be it practiced in body or in spirit. We will not deal with men on any terms but ours—and our terms are a moral code which holds that man is an end in himself and not the means to any end of others.</li><li>Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think - not blindness, but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment - on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict ‘It is.</li><li>To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That's what everybody does every hour of his life. If I asked you to keep your soul - would you understand why that's much harder?</li><li>The man who refuses to judge, who neither agrees nor disagrees, who declares that there are no absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility, is the man responsible for all the blood that is now spilled in the world. Reality is an absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust is an absolute and so is a human life. Whether you live or die is an absolute. Whether you have a piece of bread or not, is an absolute. Whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a looter's stomach, is an absolute.</li><li>Don't fool yourself, my dear. You're much worse than a bitch. You're a saint. Which shows why saints are dangerous and undesirable.</li><li>Your fear of death is not a love for life.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/36295ec999c85bd6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best John Wooden quotes that will inspire you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The above-mentioned Ayn Rand quotes are some of the best you will come across on the internet.
