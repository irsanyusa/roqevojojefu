Your <a href=# title=laptop data-link=tag>laptop</a> and all electrical appliances in&nbsp;the home go&nbsp;off. The light goes out. You get scared. At&nbsp;this moment, you hear a&nbsp;strange hissing sound. You see how, like a&nbsp;phantom, a&nbsp;round glowing ball of&nbsp;electricity flies into your house through a&nbsp;closed window.</p><p>It&nbsp;penetrates your room, hovers in&nbsp;the air, waits for something, and then flies back through the walls. The light turns&nbsp;on, and everything comes back to&nbsp;normal. You’ve just seen a&nbsp;real natural phenomenon called Ball lightning. And you’re fortunate to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alive after meeting&nbsp;it. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare phenomenon.</p><p>Ball lightning appears during a&nbsp;thunderstorm in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;floating sphere. It&nbsp;can change color from blue to&nbsp;orange and yellow. It’s the approximate size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;basketball but can also be&nbsp;much more significant. This lightning makes a&nbsp;hissing sound and a&nbsp;pungent smell. Phew.</p><p>The first records of&nbsp;ball lightning were made in&nbsp;1638 in&nbsp;<a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a>. Then a&nbsp;giant glowing ball flew into the church window. Since then, there has been a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;evidence of&nbsp;how ball lightning got into houses and frightened people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/810/abc/4e3659501ebac06092810dd2b3.png><p>In&nbsp;the 20th and 21st centuries, scientists actively investigated this phenomenon. They found out that half of&nbsp;the cases with ball lightning were just hallucinations caused by&nbsp;magnetic fields during a&nbsp;thunderstorm. But they couldn’t wholly refute the fact of&nbsp;the existence of&nbsp;ball lightning. They agreed that this phenomenon existed, and once they managed to&nbsp;record&nbsp;it.</p><p>The phenomenon of&nbsp;ball lightning was caught in&nbsp;<a href=# title=China data-link=tag>China</a>. Researchers studied the behavior of&nbsp;thunderstorms in&nbsp;2012 using video cameras and spectrometers. They saw a&nbsp;usual lightning strike, after which the ball appeared. It&nbsp;flew horizontally about 33&nbsp;feet and disappeared. The spectrometer showed that the ball consisted of&nbsp;silicon, iron, and <a href=# title=calcium data-link=tag>calcium</a>. If&nbsp;it’s real, then what is&nbsp;its nature?</p><p>There are several theories. Perhaps that ball lightning occurs as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lightning strike on&nbsp;the ground. Oxygen and evaporated elements from the soil create a&nbsp;reaction in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;round clot of&nbsp;energy. This explains why the spectrometer in&nbsp;2012 recorded the same calcium in&nbsp;the ball lightning as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the ground.</p><p>Another theory says that glass can generate these balls. Atmospheric ions accumulate on&nbsp;the glass surface and create an&nbsp;electric field. Together with a&nbsp;lightning strike, this field turns into ball lightning. That’s why there’s so&nbsp;much evidence that the sphere flies into the building through the window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4ce/e71/d55cfc5c2fbf43296272b305df.png><p>In&nbsp;2016, scientists pointed out that a&nbsp;lightning strike on&nbsp;the ground created microwave radiation that can form into a&nbsp;plasma bubble. This floating electric plasma takes a&nbsp;round shape and hovers in&nbsp;the air for a&nbsp;few seconds. Earthquakes can create ball lightning too. During ground tremors, flashes of&nbsp;light appear from the depths of&nbsp;the crust. It’s like lightning that comes not from the sky, but the ground. Some of&nbsp;these lights may look like floating blue spheres.</p><p>In&nbsp;2014, scientists studied earthquake lights and found that some rocks emit electrical discharges during seismic wave impacts. In&nbsp;2006, researchers at&nbsp;a&nbsp;university in&nbsp;Tel Aviv created a&nbsp;laboratory to&nbsp;study ball lightning. They used microwave radiation to&nbsp;recreate a&nbsp;lightning-like electric charge.</p><p>In&nbsp;2018, quantum physicists made a&nbsp;complex synthetic magnetic field similar to&nbsp;ball lightning. Physicists, chemists, meteorologists, and other scientists have conducted research and laboratory experiments many times to&nbsp;understand the nature of&nbsp;this phenomenon. But so&nbsp;far, no&nbsp;one has succeeded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/333/e08/7f83cb5270b74e16e62d77f0de.png><p>Other glowing balls are less dangerous but still mysterious. In&nbsp;clear weather, you can see strange glowing lights away from cities, somewhere in&nbsp;a&nbsp;swampy area. Previously, when there was no&nbsp;electricity, people noticed these lights, they thought someone needed help. What if&nbsp;some guy is&nbsp;stuck in&nbsp;the swamp and shines a&nbsp;kerosene lamp to&nbsp;get seen? People went to&nbsp;these lights to&nbsp;help but fell into the swamp. And the light either flew away or&nbsp;disappeared.</p><p>Some records speak of&nbsp;several lights at&nbsp;once. They moved quickly and changed their colors. Many believed that these were some kind of&nbsp;mystical creatures that lured people into traps. But over time, scientists managed to&nbsp;uncover the mystery of&nbsp;this phenomenon. Bioluminescent fungi and algae grow in&nbsp;swampy places.</p><p>Sometimes they glow with blue light and create the illusion of&nbsp;glowing lights from a&nbsp;distance. Also, there’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;plant material in&nbsp;the swamps&nbsp;— leaves, grass, mud, clay, and tree branches. These substances decompose rapidly in&nbsp;humid conditions and release methane. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;methane contacts air, it&nbsp;ignites. The flame flies over the swamp in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;a&nbsp;burning ball.</p><p>Mysterious lights appear not only in&nbsp;swamps. People see them in&nbsp;deserts or&nbsp;mountainous areas. Somewhere it’s headlights from cars. In&nbsp;other cases, it’s the signal lights of&nbsp;an&nbsp;airplane. But in&nbsp;many cases, the nature of&nbsp;such lights remains unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6ec/03b/42db3e52cdb41add35d9417e09.png><p>And now imagine a&nbsp;huge ball, the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small city. It’s like a&nbsp;dome, covers a&nbsp;large area, and protects it&nbsp;from tornados and storms. This phenomenon is&nbsp;called the Delco weather bubble and is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;Delaware County, Pennsylvania. That’s how it&nbsp;all started.</p><p>In&nbsp;1996, one of&nbsp;the strongest snow storms of&nbsp;the 20th century hit the US&nbsp;East Coast. It&nbsp;was named The Blizzard of&nbsp;1996. It&nbsp;covered almost all of&nbsp;Pennsylvania, but in&nbsp;the small town of&nbsp;Delaware County, Delco for short, the weather was good. The storm raged around but didn’t touch the city. Since that year, the locals have believed that an&nbsp;abnormal weather bubble protects their houses.</p><p>However, there’s no&nbsp;scientific evidence of&nbsp;the existence of&nbsp;this bubble. After The Blizzard of&nbsp;1996, there were several more storms in&nbsp;the area, and forecasters claimed some storms would also cover Delco. But contrary to&nbsp;their forecasts, the weather there was excellent. Strangely, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;meteorological evidence of&nbsp;this.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the residents decided to&nbsp;investigate this phenomenon seriously. He&nbsp;followed the weather forecasts, looked at&nbsp;satellite photos, and saw how the black clouds diverged around the city. It&nbsp;rained heavily in&nbsp;the neighboring towns, but not Delco. This seems like convincing proof. And the question is&nbsp;should we&nbsp;believe the locals?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/639/3d9/0719aa58dd889ccfe29a8456d2.png><p>There’s one scientific explanation explaining the nature of&nbsp;this phenomenon. Storms may weaken here thanks to&nbsp;the sea air that accumulates in&nbsp;the Delco area. The street and the city’s surrounding area are filled with this humid cold air. It&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;stabilization of&nbsp;the atmosphere. And when intense storms from the West collide with Delco’s air, they lose a&nbsp;significant part of&nbsp;their strength. And it&nbsp;seems as&nbsp;if&nbsp;bad weather just bypasses the city. But there’s another explanation. A&nbsp;psychological one.</p><p>All the known information about the weather bubble came from the stories of&nbsp;residents. They seek confirmation of&nbsp;this phenomenon and write about it&nbsp;on&nbsp;social media. Someone said that they had seen a&nbsp;tornado pass by&nbsp;his house. Others claimed that the bubble had saved them from a&nbsp;downpour. People think that it&nbsp;didn’t affect others if&nbsp;there was no&nbsp;trouble with their house.</p><p>Imagine that&nbsp;TV shows say that a&nbsp;storm has started in&nbsp;your city. You look out of&nbsp;the window and see a&nbsp;clear sky. No&nbsp;wind and rain. It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;you that the bubble has saved you again. Although behind you, a&nbsp;few hundred feet from your backyard, a&nbsp;tornado is&nbsp;raging and tearing down the roofs of&nbsp;buildings. But you didn’t see it&nbsp;and wrote to&nbsp;the social network that Delco has saved your city again. In&nbsp;this sense, the weather bubble becomes more like a&nbsp;virtual one, thanks to&nbsp;the people who write about&nbsp;it.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2BiuMtmo6KfmKm7qrrGZpqapl2lrrS%2FjK2fq6elnLVur8uoqp6cXay2r7DOsKpmmqWpeqm71mZvam1haoVw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fball-lightning-can-pass-through-closed-windows-but-how-815158.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fball-lightning-can-pass-through-closed-windows-but-how-815158.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fball-lightning-can-pass-through-closed-windows-but-how-815158.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fball-lightning-can-pass-through-closed-windows-but-how-815158.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fball-lightning-can-pass-through-closed-windows-but-how-815158.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fball-lightning-can-pass-through-closed-windows-but-how-815158.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./acces-au-logement-des-sans-abri-comment-lever-les-obstacles-locaux.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./acces-au-logement-des-sans-abri-comment-lever-les-obstacles-locaux.html>comment lever les obstacles locaux ?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./an-app-can-find-cheap-versions-of-celebrity-clothing-and-it-takes-shopping-to-a-whole-new-level-802714.html>An App Can Find Cheap Versions of Celebrity Clothing, and It Takes Shopping to a Whole New Level</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./an-app-can-find-cheap-versions-of-celebrity-clothing-and-it-takes-shopping-to-a-whole-new-level-802714.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
