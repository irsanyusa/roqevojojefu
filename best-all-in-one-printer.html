I looked at copy speed and if they had the fax option.</p><h3>Print speed</h3><p>The all-in-one printers in this roundup all have a fast ppm (page per minute). Whether you’re printing photos, brochures, or your kid’s homework, you shouldn’t have to wait around for it.</p><h3>Wireless printing</h3><p>If you’re an Apple or Android user, you want an all-in-one printer that supports AirPrint and Android wireless printing.</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>I evaluated all-in-one printers against compatibility options. I found all-in-one printers that easily connect to common operating systems like Windows and Mac. But I also found printers that just as easily connected to Chrome and Linux.</p><h3>Dimensions</h3><p>While I tried to find all-in-one printers that weren’t oversized, some all-in-one printers, specifically the ones that can be used in an office setting or for graphics, are by their nature, big. They have large paper tray capacities, and bigger print cartridges compared to home all-in-one printers designed for casual users.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-an-all-in-one-printer>What to consider when buying an all-in-one printer?</h2><h3>Usage</h3><p>I spoke with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Julissa Irias</a> from HP Communications, Worldwide Consumer Printing Solutions, to learn how to choose the best all-in-one printer for your needs. The most crucial factor to consider is usage. How often will you use all of the all-in-one functions? If you see yourself scanning, printing, and copying documents a lot, then an all-in-one printer is your best bet. Irias also says to consider “environmental fit, connectivity, cost, capacity, and sustainability.” All-in-one printers come in various sizes, from super compact to almost table-size, so look for one that best fits your needs and space.</p><h3>Ink subscriptions</h3><p>One new development in the printer market is the option for ink subscription services specific to your printer. This is how it works: The printer automatically senses when ink cartridges are low, and then you’re sent new ones. Here’s where it gets wonky. If you cancel the subscription and still use the printer cartridge that was part of it, the company from which you bought the printer can “brick” you, i.e., not allow you to use the cartridge to print. However, if you try to use a non-branded printer cartridge, the printer can block you from doing so. Every printer runs on software. They’re now built to auto-update, and that software could also block customers from using any ink cartridge they want. So, what steps can a customer take to prevent the ink subscription issue? Simply put, don’t purchase the subscription.</p><h3>Printing technology</h3><p>Laser or inkjet? Inkjet printers are better for color printing, while <a rel=alternate href=#>laser printers</a> are faster and more cost-effective when it comes to black and white printing.</p><h3>Print speed</h3><p>How many pages per minute (ppm) can the printer handle? Home all-in-one printers aren’t going to print a thousand-page document while you recline in your comfy <a rel=alternate href=#>office chair</a>, but if you want something speedy, check out that function.</p><h3>Print quality</h3><p>Look for sharpness of images, color accuracy, and overall quality.</p><h3>Connectivity options</h3><p>How does the all-in-one printer integrate with your home devices? Does it use <a rel=alternate href=#>Wi-Fi</a>, Bluetooth, Ethernet, or USB? Look for a printer that easily fits into what you’re using at home. As an aside, Wi-Fi capabilities allow you to print from multiple devices.</p><h3>Compatibility</h3><p>Ensure the all-in-one printer is compatible with your phone, laptop, desktop computer, or other electronic device you may want to print from.</p><h3>Scanner quality and features</h3><p>Look into the scanner’s resolution and speed and whether it has an automatic document feeder (ADF) for multi-page documents.</p><h3>Size and design</h3><p>Measure the space where the printer will sit and ensure that its dimensions will fit comfortably in that space.</p><h3>Energy efficient</h3><p>Some printers are more energy efficient than others. Look for ones that are ENERGY STAR certified, which means they meet strict guidelines set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Energy efficient products are better for the environment because they use clean energy. According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>ENERGY STAR’s website</a>, “Clean energy is generated from renewable sources without producing any pollution [as opposed to fossil fuel], which helps to improve the health of the environment and reduces the amounts of harmful emissions people are exposed to.” The use of clean energy slows global warming and reduces the amount of toxins added to the environment.</p><h2 id=what-does-an-all-in-one-printer-mean>What does an all-in-one printer mean?</h2><p>All-in-one printers are multi-functional devices. They can print, scan, fax (yes, some people still fax!), and copy. Irias says the term is typically used for home printers because “office devices use ‘MFP’ or Multi-Function Printer.” Many home printers, including HP home printers, have enhanced functionality. Irias explains that home all-in-one printers have cool extras like “mobile app solutions, security, and easy supply replenishment with HP Instant Ink with Paper Add-On included.”</p><h2 id=all-in-one-printer-basic-care-and-maintenance>All-in-one printer basic care and maintenance</h2><ul><li>Use original supplies and media for the best output. Some printer companies will reject off-brand ink and lock down the printer until the ink is switched to the correct brand.</li><li>Follow the printer’s manual for maintenance and cleaning.</li><li>Dust it. Built-up dust can cause issues with any type of device or machine.</li><li>Use the right device for the correct job. If multiple people use a home all-in-one printer in an office environment, it does a job it’s not intended to do. That means the printer may start having print, copy, or scan issues due to overuse. Always buy the suitable machine for the job.</li></ul><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the difference between home and office all-in-one printers?</h3><p>Home printers can have the same all-in-one functions as an office all-in-one printer. However, office printers tend to be designed for heavier use with faster printing speeds and larger paper tray capacities. Because of their increased capacity, they may be larger in size than home printers. Office all-in-one printers can also have better print quality but home all-in-ones may print higher quality photos.</p><h3>Which company’s all-in-one printer is the best?</h3><p>This is a tricky question to ask, simply because everyone has their preferences. Some people swear by anything Canon or Epson makes. Other people will never buy anything but Brother all-in-one printers. Then, some people have only used, and will only use, HP printers. Personally, I have used a few different printers, but have kept going back to HP for two reasons: ease of use and inexpensive ink. The best all-in-one printer is the one that works best for you.</p><h3>What are the disadvantages of owning an all-in-one printer?</h3><p>When all-in-one printers first arrived, if you had an issue with one of the functions, chances are the entire machine would break down. With all the improvements and iterations, now if your scanner isn’t working or you have copying issues, your printer will still work while you read the support materials to fix it. Nowadays, troubleshooting a problem is quick and painless.</p><h3>How often should you change the ink in an all-in-one printer?</h3><p>“Assuming the right printer has been chosen for the respective use case, cartridges can last for three to six months,” says Irias.</p><h3>Why are all-in-one printers suitable for home use?</h3><p>Irias points out that they’re compact and multi-functional and can be used for school, work, or family. On a personal note, I can quickly spot typos and grammatical errors if I print something I'm working on.</p><h3>What is the average service life of an all-in-one printer?</h3><p>Depending on the usage, an all-in-one printer can last three to five years on average.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkaG5brXNZqannV2lv6q6056paA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-all-in-one-printer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-all-in-one-printer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-all-in-one-printer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-all-in-one-printer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-all-in-one-printer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-all-in-one-printer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-to-buy-nike-air-jordan-4-retro-sneakers-online-1235989785.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-to-buy-nike-air-jordan-4-retro-sneakers-online-1235989785.html>Heres Where to Get a Pair of Nikes New Air Jordan 4 Sneakers Online</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./baby-river-utah-hospital-lily.html>Baby Who Survived 12 Hours in a Utah River Is Out of Hospital</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./baby-river-utah-hospital-lily.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
