<time>30 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Great music is meant to be heard on great sound systems. When I made my <a href=# rel=nofollow>music documentary</a> about legendary soul singer Lee Fields, I listened to awe-inspiring musical tracks, so it was important to have a set of high-quality headphones at the ready. But quality headphones are an important investment for everyone, from music and media professionals, to music lovers, gamers, or anyone simply craving a static-free phone call with the family.</p><p>The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e over-ear headphones are a premium option that are still offered at a significant discount compared to other premium headphones. But are they right for you? Read on for my impressions after getting the chance to test them out.</p><p><h3 class=title>Px7 s2e Headphones - Bowers & Wilkins</h3></p><h2 id=unboxing-and-first-impressions>Unboxing and first impressions</h2><p>Much like the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Px8</a>, the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e</a> has an attractive case that feels solidly constructed. With an investment this significant, it’s reassuring to know your deluxe headphones will always have serious protection. One difference I immediately noticed is that the Px7 S2e has a cloth zipper pull for the headphones, while the Px8 model has a leather one. While I appreciated the leather zipper pull, the cloth zipper also looks great and works as effectively. And over time, I began to appreciate the soft nature of the cloth zipper pull, as opposed to the somewhat stiffer leather pull on the Px8.</p><p>The headphones themselves are elegantly designed, while still seeming sturdy enough that I’d feel safe tossing them into a bag and heading out, perhaps not even bothering with the case. The fit of the headphones is a bit snug, but it’s something that I adjusted to quickly. The secure fit of the headphones is a helpful feature for those who use them while working out, since they’re unlikely to slip off your head. This advantage will also be useful for those seeking a <a href=# rel=alternate>gaming headset</a> that will stay safely in place. The ability to swivel and rotate the earphones lets you adjust them to your needs, as well as store them more quickly and easily.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/d1cf651f807fa3ae23661f78f926ae34/76902/photo-3-box-with-outer-cover-removed.jpg></span></span><p>JESSAMYN ANSARY</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/9980f5d778531560c587dc082d9f1557/76902/soundcore-life-q-35-headphones.jpg></span></span><p>JESSAMYN ANSARY</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/80f3737669356b6ae911278fb5777853/d5df4/photo-2-back-of-box.jpg></span></span><p>JESSAMYN ANSARY</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/b70636918e61025717deb83704eeafab/d5df4/photo-1-front-of-box.jpg></span></span><p>JESSAMYN ANSARY</p><h2 id=pros-and-cons>Pros and cons</h2><p>The Px7 S2e headphones from Bowers & Wilkins are sleek, impressively priced compared to the Px8, and perhaps most important—they sound great. They feature a stylish appearance and a solid build, as you would expect from a premium headphone in this price range. The Px7 S2e also uses the same app as the Px8, which is useful. It’s easy to connect a new Bowers & Wilkins product to the app and you can quickly get a battery percentage reading, change the environmental controls, or adjust the overall EQ levels. The 30 hours of battery life is also impressive, providing peace of mind during long journeys. The Bluetooth range for these <a href=# rel=alternate>wireless headphones</a> is over 30 feet, which provides a generous amount of freedom to roam.</p><p>The earphones can quite easily swivel, which is useful during wear and storage. And they come in a quality case, which is a huge bonus. The memory foam ear pads and soft fabric ear pad covers make these headphones feel ultra comfortable, despite the snug fit. Like most <a href=# rel=alternate>noise-canceling headphones</a>, the Px7 S2e has a tighter fit than other categories of headphones. While the ANC (active noise-canceling) feature can seem a little extreme at first, the ability to adjust it with different levels makes it much easier to adapt to that level of isolation.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0d67aa85f5130d5ac840fa501b489b71/76902/photo-4-box-open-with-closed-case-inside.jpg></span></span><p>JESSAMYN ANSARY</p><p>If you’re used to using in-ear headphones or <a href=# rel=alternate>wireless earbuds</a>, the weight of the Px7 S2e might take some getting used to; they’re 307 grams without the carrying case. However, they are very similar in weight to other headphones in the same category. While the Px7 S2e seems to be built in a manner to withstand heavy usage, they are not designed to be waterproof. This is a bit disappointing, but expected for most headphones of this type.</p><h2 id=price>Price</h2><p>$399.00</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Amazon</a></p><p>$399</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Bowers & Wilkins</a></p><p><h3 class=title>Px7 s2e Headphones - Bowers & Wilkins</h3></p><h2 id=key-features>Key features</h2><ul><li><h3>Enhanced noise canceling</h3></li></ul><p>The Px7 S2e shines at the task of noise canceling. The six different built-in microphones allow the headphones to excel at things like phone calls, where it does a wonderful job of removing unwanted noises. This feature is also adjustable — another plus.</p><ul><li><h3>Sound performance</h3></li></ul><p>The “e” in Px7 S2e stands for “evolved” and these headphones are a clear upgrade over some past iterations. This new version has definite acoustic improvements, like the 40mm drive units inside each ear cup. Overall, its balanced sound rivals that of its big brother the Px8, though the Px8 has a slight edge.</p><p>The mobile app from Bowers & Wilkins was useful, and I enjoyed having the option to enable voice support, as well as the ability to stream directly. Being able to quickly see what percentage of battery life I had remaining was another great feature.</p><p>While I chose the headphones in a classic black design, it was refreshing to see that the Px7 S2e also comes in Cloud Grey, Forest Green, and Ocean Blue. These additional color options offer users some variety, and feel modern and fun.</p><p>Every inch of these headphones has the feel of a premium product — from the overall sturdy design, to the attractive metal detailing, to the memory foam ear pads that are soft and luxurious.</p><p><h3 class=title>Px7 s2e Headphones - Bowers & Wilkins</h3></p><h2 id=bowers--wilkins-px7-s2e-wireless-headphones-are-these-a-good-fit-for-you>Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e Wireless Headphones: Are these a good fit for you?</h2><p>Based on value and performance, the Px7 S2e are impressive headphones. They’re a luxury item with a price tag to match, but they’re similarly priced to the Sonos, their competition from Sony. They also have many of the same features as their pricier counterpart, the Px8—just at a lower cost. I found that the Px7 S2e very quickly became an essential part of my daily routine. The sound quality is excellent and the noise-canceling capability offers a new way to hear your music and calls.</p><p>The Px7 S2e does not offer the precise audio response of the Px8, especially in the upper and middle range of frequencies. However, the low-end frequencies of the Px7 S2e are still remarkable. These headphones are also quite sturdy and comfortable to wear. After getting used to the features and design, I was more than ready to take these with me everywhere.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/b20acc5fab2a3ebd581505e5f69df776/76902/photo-6-headphones-removed-from-case.jpg></span></span><p>JESSAMYN ANSARY</p><h2 id=performance>Performance</h2><p>The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e offers excellent sound quality. The bass frequencies sounded full and overall performance was exemplary.</p><p>30 hours of playback instantly allows you to freely go about your business before even thinking about stopping for a charge. And speaking of charges, you can even get a 7-hour boost on your battery life with just 15 minutes of charge—an impressive feature.</p><ul><li><h3>Bluetooth range</h3></li></ul><p>With over 30 feet of Bluetooth range, this felt as good or better than most headphones in this category. It was rare that I unknowingly wandered outside of the acceptable range.</p><p>Gorgeously designed and tastefully constructed, these Px7 S2e headphones felt like the pinnacle of luxury throughout. They feature ultra-soft memory foam earpads encased in a fabric finish and thoughtfully designed metal detailing. The six microphones also help with noise cancellation and call quality.</p><p><h3 class=title>Px7 s2e Headphones - Bowers & Wilkins</h3></p><h2 id=design-and-build-quality>Design and build quality</h2><h3>Build quality</h3><p>Much like the Px8, the Px7 S2e offers simplicity of design combined with beautiful build quality. In addition to their plush earpads and intricate metal detailing, it’s clear that much work went into the thoughtful construction of the Px7. The sound is rich with warm bass, and the 24-bit processing and 40mm drivers also speak to the design quality. Coupled with the convenience of 30-hour playback and fast charging capability, the Px7 S2e has been carefully crafted with the user in mind.</p><h3>Durability and portability</h3><p>And while durability can often be most accurately judged over long periods and wear, my instant assessment of the Px7 S2e is that these are made for the long haul. The weight of headphones adds to the sturdy feel, yet they’re still lightweight enough to be easily transportable.</p><h3>Noise canceling</h3><p>The noise-canceling capabilities are one of the most impressive features. These headphones allow you to easily adapt to your surroundings by adjusting the noise-canceling levels — a feature I found useful.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final verdict</h2><p>The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e headphones have a fantastic sound and comfortable feel that quickly molds to your needs. The headphones do fit snuggly, but always feel luxurious due to the ultra-soft ear pads. Phone calls were also a joy with the six microphones easily picking up my voice and the earphones easily isolating my ears from outside sound, increasing my ability to hear the other caller. It took some time to get used to having phone calls with no microphones anywhere near my mouth. But once I adjusted, this became a huge advantage on phone calls, making my hands feel even more free. The Bowers & Wilkins app is also something you may or may not use, but it’s simple, well-designed and is worth downloading. The streaming services and tone control capability are just a couple reasons I returned to use it.</p><p>The biggest difference between the Px7 S2e and the Px8 is sound. The Px8 headphones have an even more refined output of sound than the Px7 S2e and that’s reflected in the price difference. But that doesn’t mean anything is disappointing about the Px7 S2e. While perhaps adding a little enhanced bass frequencies to most things, the Px7 S2e still manages to sound well-rounded and never exaggerated or distorted.</p><p>The active noise-canceling features are a game-changer, allowing your music to be showcased in the best possible way. This useful feature alone makes these <a href=# rel=alternate>over-ear headphones</a> worth considering. The level of noise cancellation is often so good, you can even find yourself wanting breaks from that level of isolation, so the ability to add in more outside noise with the touch of a button is also useful. With a simple but beautiful design, exciting audio response, and all-around luxurious feel, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e has quickly become headphones I would recommend.</p><p><h3 class=title>Px7 s2e Headphones - Bowers & Wilkins</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Gorp6qo2Kur7CMsKClo5mjwG6813BkrGqVYr%2Bmwsiermg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2e-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2e-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2e-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2e-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2e-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbowers-and-wilkins-px7-s2e-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bre-tiesi-shares-how-she-defines-her-relationship-with-nick-cannon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bre-tiesi-shares-how-she-defines-her-relationship-with-nick-cannon.html>Bre Tiesi Shares How She Defines Her Relationship with Nick Cannon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./history-black-friday.html>Black Friday History: How the Shopping Holiday Started</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./history-black-friday.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
