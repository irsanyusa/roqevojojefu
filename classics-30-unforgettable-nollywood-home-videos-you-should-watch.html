These movies were known as home videos.</p><p>The 90s was dominated by home videos. Cheaply produced and shot within a couple of weeks, this movie scene (later to be christened Nollywood in 2002) flooded the country, then the West African sub-region, Africa and the diaspora.</p><p>The home video industry would eventually peter out due to the Nollywood ban of 2004. Today, the movie is at a crossroads with one eye on big cinematic releases and another eye still on the past of home videos.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>No matter what the future has in store, we cannot forget the years when Nollywood home videos reigned supreme, years of dedication and hard work and also low technical skills.</p><p>Below is a list of unforgettable Nollywood home videos in no ranking order;</p><p>1) Rattle Snake* (Directed by Amaka Igwe/1995)</p><p>Storyline- <strong>Ahanna Okolo</strong> is a young man who goes into a life of crime due to unfortunate events in his childhood.
