<time>01 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>On&nbsp;April&nbsp;10, 1912, the RMS Titanic set sail from England. But this wasn’t the launch of&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular <a href=# title=ship data-link=tag>ship</a>. The Titanic was the largest liner ever built at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>It&nbsp;was 882 feet long&nbsp;— that’s nearly the size of&nbsp;three soccer fields! And measured from the hull to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the smokestacks, the ship was an&nbsp;impressive 175 feet tall! That’s the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;17-story building. Deemed “unsinkable,” it&nbsp;took 3,000 workers almost 3&nbsp;years to&nbsp;build.</p><p>But a&nbsp;mere four days into its very first voyage, at&nbsp;11:40&nbsp;PM, the ship collided with an&nbsp;iceberg and was lost beneath the waves of&nbsp;the Atlantic <a href=# title=Ocean data-link=tag>Ocean</a>. It&nbsp;took the liner only 2&nbsp;hours and 40&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;sink. And of&nbsp;more than 2,200 passengers and crew members on&nbsp;board, only 706&nbsp;survived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e57/cc6/42327557e5a3e7c5c1ec5273cb.png><p>The wreck would remain lost for another 73&nbsp;years, hiding its many secrets within the frigid Atlantic waters. And if&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t for a&nbsp;man whose whole life had been devoted to&nbsp;exploring the sea, the giant ship might have remained lost for a&nbsp;lot longer. That man was Robert Ballard.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, Ballard was obsessed with the ocean. This fascination started when he&nbsp;was just 12&nbsp;years old. That’s when he&nbsp;watched a&nbsp;film adaptation of&nbsp;Jules Verne’s science fiction novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. It&nbsp;had everything to&nbsp;spark a&nbsp;young person’s imagination&nbsp;— from <a href=# title=adventure data-link=tag>adventure</a> and strange creatures to&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful underwater vehicle called the Nautilus. It&nbsp;could travel anywhere in&nbsp;the world you wanted to&nbsp;go.</p><p>From that moment, life on&nbsp;dry land was no&nbsp;longer in&nbsp;Ballard’s future. When he&nbsp;was&nbsp;23, he&nbsp;was assigned to&nbsp;the Deep Submergence Group. There, he&nbsp;helped develop techniques to&nbsp;search the ocean floor. His biggest accomplishment was the creation of&nbsp;Alvin. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;small, easy to&nbsp;maneuver submarine that could carry three people. It&nbsp;also featured an&nbsp;external mechanical arm, designed to&nbsp;gather underwater samples while the crew remained safe and dry inside.</p><p>Alvin the submarine quickly proved useful for a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;tasks. For example, once, it&nbsp;was used to&nbsp;track down an&nbsp;aircraft that had crashed into the sea. But the vessel experienced a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;setbacks. In&nbsp;one case, it&nbsp;was attacked by&nbsp;a&nbsp;swordfish, which caused the submarine to&nbsp;resurface quickly. The swordfish, still stuck in&nbsp;the outer skin of&nbsp;the submarine, became that night’s dinner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ef6/919/5d87ba56999e1966ccfe6854b3.png><p>And in&nbsp;October 1968, the submarine was being lowered into the water when the cables holding it&nbsp;snapped, sending it&nbsp;careening into the ocean along with three crew members on&nbsp;board! And because the small vessel was still open, it&nbsp;immediately filled with water and quickly began to&nbsp;sink! Luckily, the crew managed to&nbsp;escape, but Alvin was gone. Bad <a href=# title=weather data-link=tag>weather</a> hampered multiple attempts to&nbsp;recover the vessel. It&nbsp;wasn’t until the following year that it&nbsp;was finally returned to&nbsp;the surface.</p><p>In&nbsp;time, Alvin would be&nbsp;improved. Its hull would be&nbsp;strengthened by&nbsp;titanium, giving it&nbsp;a&nbsp;higher depth rating, thus making it&nbsp;even better suited for ocean exploration. The specialized submarine would come in&nbsp;handy in&nbsp;many of&nbsp;Ballard’s 100-plus expeditions. The man was one of&nbsp;the first to&nbsp;explore an&nbsp;underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean. And when he&nbsp;found thermal vents in&nbsp;the Galápagos Rift in&nbsp;the late 70s, he&nbsp;also helped discover and document the process of&nbsp;chemosynthesis. That’s a&nbsp;complicated chemical synthesis of&nbsp;food energy by&nbsp;bacteria.</p><p>But his biggest discovery was still to&nbsp;come. Ballard claimed he’d never been a&nbsp;“Titanic fanatic.” But he&nbsp;eventually became obsessed with finding the ship after watching other explorers try and fail. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;said, “Titanic was clearly the big Mount Everest at&nbsp;the time. Many others had tried. Many that&nbsp;I thought would have succeeded or&nbsp;should have succeeded but didn’t.” Ballard began thinking about finding the ship as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;1973.</p><p>And four years later, he&nbsp;actually made an&nbsp;attempt. He&nbsp;used the deep-sea salvage vessel Seaprobe, which was a&nbsp;drillship equipped with cameras and sonar. But he&nbsp;was forced to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;when the drilling pipe broke. It&nbsp;just wasn’t his time. In&nbsp;the early 80s, a&nbsp;Texas oilman named Jack Grimm tried to&nbsp;find the wreck on&nbsp;3&nbsp;different occasions. Once, Grimm was actually right over the Titanic, but his equipment failed to&nbsp;detect&nbsp;it! That’s what we&nbsp;call extreme bad luck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bde/f93/a1a1e95d14bc0f0a21bcc1629d.png><p>Ballard was just biding his time. He&nbsp;needed a&nbsp;plan. And some help. The first issue was getting down to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the Atlantic. The furthest down he&nbsp;had ever traveled before was 20,000&nbsp;feet. And this trip took him three hours. And that didn’t include the way back&nbsp;up!</p><p>Ballard knew he&nbsp;could use Alvin, already enhanced with a&nbsp;titanium hull to&nbsp;withstand the pressure of&nbsp;the ocean. But he&nbsp;also needed something that didn’t require him to&nbsp;actually go&nbsp;down with&nbsp;it. An&nbsp;un-piloted remote-controlled submarine would be&nbsp;ideal. But first, he&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;create one. He&nbsp;reached out to&nbsp;the authorities, hoping they would provide funding for his project. And though officials had no&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;the Titanic, they were willing to&nbsp;help.</p><p>Ah! But there was a&nbsp;catch. Ballard had to&nbsp;first focus on&nbsp;tracking down two submarines, the Thresher and the Scorpion, which had sunk to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean in&nbsp;the 1960s. The authorities were hoping to&nbsp;study them to&nbsp;find out why they had sunk in&nbsp;the first place. They also wanted to&nbsp;know if&nbsp;they could be&nbsp;recovered or&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was safe to&nbsp;leave them on&nbsp;the ocean floor. Only when he&nbsp;had successfully completed this task would he&nbsp;be&nbsp;free to&nbsp;use any remaining time on&nbsp;his contract to&nbsp;find the Titanic.</p><p>With no&nbsp;other options for funding, Ballard took the offer. He&nbsp;got to&nbsp;work. First, he&nbsp;created two new devices. Argo was an&nbsp;un-piloted deep-towed undersea video camera sled. It&nbsp;was designed to&nbsp;take photos and record videos from a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;cameras mounted on&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;could work at&nbsp;depths of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;20,000&nbsp;feet, and it&nbsp;could also explore nearly&nbsp;98% of&nbsp;the ocean floor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/94b/b82/f4109951f395d0fcb1923b758e.png><p>Argo was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tethered to&nbsp;a&nbsp;boat. As&nbsp;the boat moved, Argo would be&nbsp;pulled behind, floating just above the ocean floor. The camera would then transmit images to&nbsp;the surface. The second device was a&nbsp;small robotic vehicle called Jason Jr. It&nbsp;was also controlled remotely, which allowed the crew inside a&nbsp;submarine, like Alvin, to&nbsp;get closer to&nbsp;and photograph underwater objects.</p><p>Ballard was now ready. He&nbsp;knew he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;find those submarines quickly. And it&nbsp;didn’t take him long. Much to&nbsp;his relief, the search was relatively simple, and he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;fulfill his obligations with 12&nbsp;days to&nbsp;spare.</p><p>With almost two weeks to&nbsp;devote to&nbsp;finding the Titanic, he&nbsp;set out to&nbsp;explore the ocean. He&nbsp;focused the search close to&nbsp;Newfoundland, Canada, pulling Argo along the ocean floor and reviewing the images it&nbsp;collected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/33a/df8/bbb23350d1841f09b33824dfa7.png><p>And after a&nbsp;few days of&nbsp;nothing, they eventually found riveted hull plates and a&nbsp;boiler. Could this be&nbsp;it?! The next day, a&nbsp;ship’s large bow was revealed. On&nbsp;September&nbsp;1, 1985, Ballard and his fellow crew members realized they had finally found the infamous ship.</p><p>The discovery resulted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;emotions. Ballard was excited to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first to&nbsp;find the Titanic’s final resting place. But he&nbsp;was also overwhelmed by&nbsp;the sense of&nbsp;grief for those who had suffered when the ship had gone down. Over the next four days, the crew explored the wreck. They found the crow’s nest, from where the iceberg had first been spotted.</p><p>Plus, there was finally evidence of&nbsp;how the massive ship had split in&nbsp;two before sinking&nbsp;— with both halves of&nbsp;the ship found. There was furniture and dinnerware. And, sadly, several leather shoes of&nbsp;those who hadn’t made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;safety were scattered about the ocean floor. Ballard succeeded where others had failed and became an&nbsp;instant celebrity around the world. You’d think that locating the Titanic would be&nbsp;enough for one man. But not for Ballard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ead/7e2/f5878a5bcf9930e2732d3fb5c9.png><p>In&nbsp;2019, he&nbsp;took on&nbsp;the challenge of&nbsp;solving another mystery: the disappearance of&nbsp;Amelia Earhart. Earhart had attempted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first woman to&nbsp;fly around the world. Unfortunately, she disappeared somewhere over the Pacific Ocean in&nbsp;1937. She and her plane were never found.</p><p>Ballard hoped that his luck with the Titanic would help with finding where Earhart had gone down. But his expedition failed to&nbsp;find anything. And though Robert Ballard has found more shipwrecks than anybody else, it’s only the tip of&nbsp;the iceberg. It’s estimated that there are over three million shipwrecks in&nbsp;the ocean, and Ballard has only located 100 of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Now, in&nbsp;his 80s, the man is&nbsp;hoping to&nbsp;encourage young people to&nbsp;continue his work of&nbsp;exploring the ocean and its many mysteries. In&nbsp;1989, he&nbsp;started the Jason Learning Project to&nbsp;inspire grade school students to&nbsp;pursue science, technology, engineering, and math. He&nbsp;also has his own research vessel called the E.V. Nautilus after the name of&nbsp;the submarine in&nbsp;Jules Verne’s novel. A&nbsp;fitting tribute to&nbsp;the story that inspired his career.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWmecWorKecXam1pnnToquappmYeqPFjJqanKGUmru1eZdqa25uaGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhe-found-the-titanic-by-accident-814568.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhe-found-the-titanic-by-accident-814568.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhe-found-the-titanic-by-accident-814568.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhe-found-the-titanic-by-accident-814568.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhe-found-the-titanic-by-accident-814568.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhe-found-the-titanic-by-accident-814568.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./invincible-creator-robert-kirkman-wants-eight-seasons-prime-video-1235733759.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./invincible-creator-robert-kirkman-wants-eight-seasons-prime-video-1235733759.html>Invincible Creator Robert Kirkman Wants Animated Series to Run for Seven to Eight Season</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fifty-shades-darker-bella-heathcote-joins-franchise-as-leila-christian-greys-ex-lover.html>Bella Heathcote joins franchise as Leila, Christian Grey's ex-lover</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fifty-shades-darker-bella-heathcote-joins-franchise-as-leila-christian-greys-ex-lover.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
