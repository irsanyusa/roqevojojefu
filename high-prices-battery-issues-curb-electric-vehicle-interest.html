Over that two-year period, price has emerged as the top reason for why EV holdouts haven’t purchased one, despite some recent price cuts in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. have both slashed prices, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>others are waiting out</a> a price war, and Toyota Motor Corp. has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>shuffled its executive leadership</a> to hone in on EVs.

The number was highest for hybrids, with 3,474.5 fires per 100,000 sales.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“I think one of the things that you see is that when we get a new technology, the safety concerns pop up,” said Haresh Kamath, director of distributed energy resources and energy storage at EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the incidents are relatively rare, they are important and must be taken seriously, he added. There is not one general reason for the battery fires, as it depends on the specific instance.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“What we can say is that we've learned a great deal the last few years,” Kamath said. “And even in those circumstances where we don't know what the causes are, we have some confidence that we can prevent the worst effects of these fires from occurring so that the overall product is safer.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The industry has been reaching out to first responders more recently, with a great deal of information coming from the automakers and manufacturers about the risks and how to address the fires when they happen.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A spokesperson for the National Fire Protection Association said that “EVs are inherently no more dangerous than internal combustion engine vehicles from a fire safety perspective. However, behavior and characteristics of EV fires differ from ICE incidents and present unique challenges to first responders.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“While EV fires appear to be a less common occurrence, statistical data on the frequency of EV fires is needed. However, EVs are more complicated of an event for responders since these fires can last longer and have the potential for electrical shock and reignition,” the NFPA added.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In the meantime, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is working on a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>rulemaking proposal</a> that will include requirements for mitigating fires of electric vehicle batteries and considerations for emergency response guidance to first and second responders.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In addition to battery fires, nearly half of EV holdouts cited major concerns about the potential for the battery to lose charge during colder weather. Across the United States, concern was highest in the Midwest, where slightly more than half of adults said they were concerned with cold starts (52%) and battery fires (51%).&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>December report from Recurrent Motors Inc.</a> showed that some EVs can lose up to 35% of their range in freezing conditions, but the range loss varies depending on each model. Cold temperatures affect the chemical and physical reactions in the battery and EVs don’t produce “waste heat” like internal combustion engines do, the report noted, and that heat helps warm up the inside of the vehicle, whereas EVs must make their own heat, drawing energy from the battery and lowering the range.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>More access to charging stations still needed for most EV holdouts</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In addition to high prices and concerns about battery fires and cold weather performance, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>charging remains a primary concern</a> for those who are not considering buying an EV or hybrid in the coming years. Roughly 3 in 5 said they’re concerned about needing to charge the vehicles too often or that it’s inconvenient to find charging stations.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">EV holdouts also appear to still love their traditional cars: Preference for gas-powered vehicles grew between 2021 and 2023 by 6 points, with 60% citing it as a major reason why they were not interested in purchasing an EV or hybrid.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The survey also indicated how consumer attitudes on EVs could be swayed to increase purchasing likelihood.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Almost 3 in 5 adults said they would consider purchasing an EV or hybrid over the next decade if money were no object and if there were plenty of charging stations nearby. A third of respondents said removing cost and charging issues still wouldn’t make them likely to buy an EV.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">During the span of the two surveys, the Biden administration and the industry worked to expand access to more charging stations. After eight months of debate, the administration recently released national EV charger network rules <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>requiring that chargers must be made in the United States</a>, with 55% of their costs coming from domestically made components by 2024.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In an effort to qualify for more subsidies under the Combined Charging System standard, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Tesla committed</a> to opening up part of its charging network to non-Tesla drivers. The company aims to offer 3,500 new and existing superchargers along highways and 4,000 slower chargers at hotels and restaurants. The initiative also includes <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>commitments</a> from General Motors Co., Ford and ChargePoint.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">BP PLC is also working to expand its existing fuel and charging network with a recent <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>$1.3 billion purchase of TravelCenters of America Inc</a>. The announcement came after BP said it would invest $1 billion to bring fast-charging points to more than a dozen cities in partnership with car rental agency Hertz Global Holdings Inc., with the ultimate goal of having <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>more than 100,000 chargers globally</a> by 2030.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But even with more charging station options in the future, almost half of adults who don’t own an EV said their budget for buying one would stay the same, while a quarter said they were not interested in an EV at any price. A smaller fraction of adults (16%) said they would spend more for an EV than a gas-powered vehicle if charging were plentiful, while another sliver (13%) said they would only be interested in an EV if it cost less than a gas-powered vehicle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOoaCgoF2lv6qvxKxkm5mkqbKzxYyiqqytlah6pMHRm2SepJWYwbO1wmatnqCZmLmmecinq56qlajB</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhigh-prices-battery-issues-curb-electric-vehicle-interest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhigh-prices-battery-issues-curb-electric-vehicle-interest.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhigh-prices-battery-issues-curb-electric-vehicle-interest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhigh-prices-battery-issues-curb-electric-vehicle-interest.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhigh-prices-battery-issues-curb-electric-vehicle-interest.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhigh-prices-battery-issues-curb-electric-vehicle-interest.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./heres-how-to-increase-your-spanish-vocabulary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./heres-how-to-increase-your-spanish-vocabulary.html>How to Increase Your Spanish Vocabulary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./acces-au-logement-des-sans-abri-comment-lever-les-obstacles-locaux.html>comment lever les obstacles locaux ?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./acces-au-logement-des-sans-abri-comment-lever-les-obstacles-locaux.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
