Thirty hours? Forty? Would it surprise you to learn that some elementary school kids have workweeks comparable to adults’ schedules? For most children, mandatory <a href=#>homework assignments</a> push their workweek far beyond the school day and deep into what any other laborers would consider overtime. Even without sports or music or other school-sponsored extracurriculars, the daily homework slog keeps many students on the clock as long as lawyers, teachers, medical residents, truck drivers and other overworked adults. Is it any wonder that,deprived of the labor protections that we provide adults, our kids are suffering an <a href=#>epidemic of disengagement, anxiety and depression</a>?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With my youngest child just months away from finishing high school, I’m remembering all the needless misery and missed opportunities all three of my kids suffered because of their endless assignments. When my daughters were in middle school, I would urge them into bed before midnight and then find them clandestinely studying under the covers with a flashlight. We cut back on their activities but still found ourselves stuck in a system on overdrive, returning home from hectic days at 6 p.m. only to face hours more of homework. Now, even as a senior with a moderate course load, my son, Zak, has spent many weekends studying, finding little time for the exercise and fresh air essential to his well-being. Week after week, and without any extracurriculars, Zak logs a lot more than the 40 hours adults traditionally work each week — and with no recognition from his “bosses” that it’s too much. I can’t count the number of shared evenings, weekend outings and dinners that our family has missed and will never get back.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How much after-school time should our schools really own?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the midst of the madness last fall, Zak said to me, “I feel like I’m working towards my death. The constant demands on my time since 5th grade are just going to continue through graduation, into college, and then into my job. It’s like I’m on an endless treadmill with no time for living.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My spirit crumbled along with his.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like Zak, many people are now questioning<b></b> the point of putting so much demand on children and teens that they become thinly stretched and overworked. Studies have long shown that there is no academic benefit to <a href=# rel=noopener>high school homework</a> that consumes more than a modest number of hours each week. In a study of high schoolers conducted by the <a href=# rel=noopener>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> (OECD), researchers concluded that “after around four hours of homework per week, the additional time invested in homework has a negligible impact on performance.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In elementary school, where we often assign overtime even to the youngest children, studies have shown there’s <a href=# rel=noopener>no academic benefit to <i>any</i> amount of homework</a> at all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Our unquestioned acceptance of homework also flies in the face of all we know about human health, brain function and learning. Brain scientists know that <a href=# rel=noopener>rest</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>exercise are essential to good health and real learning</a>. Even top adult professionals in specialized fields take care to limit their work to concentrated periods of focus. A <a href=# rel=noopener>landmark study</a> of how humans develop expertise found that elite musicians, scientists and athletes do their most productive work only about <a href=# rel=noopener>four hours per day</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet we continue to overwork our children, depriving them of the chance to cultivate health and learn deeply, burdening them with an imbalance of sedentary, academic tasks. <a href=# rel=noopener>American high school students</a>, in fact, do more homework each week than their peers in the average country in the OECD, a 2014 <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a> found.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s time for an uprising.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Already, small rebellions are starting. High schools in <a href=# rel=noopener>Ridgewood, N.J.</a>, and Fairfax County, Va., among others, have banned homework over school breaks. The entire second grade at <a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Elementary School</a> in Arlington, Va., abolished homework this academic year. <a href=# rel=noopener>Burton Valley Elementary School</a> in Lafayette, Calif., has eliminated homework in grades K through 4. <a href=# rel=noopener>Henry West Laboratory School</a>, a public K-8 school in Coral Gables, Fla., eliminated mandatory, graded homework for optional assignments. One Lexington, Mass., elementary school is piloting a homework-free year, replacing it with reading for pleasure.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Across the Atlantic, students in Spain launched a <a href=# rel=noopener>national strike</a> against excessive assignments in November. And a second-grade teacher in Texas, made headlines this fall when she <a href=# rel=noopener>quit sending home extra work</a>, instead urging families to “spend your evenings doing things that are proven to correlate with student success. Eat dinner as a family, read together, play outside and get your child to bed early.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It is time that we call loudly for a clear and simple change: a workweek limit for children, counting time on the clock before and after the final bell. Why should schools extend their authority far beyond the boundaries of campus, dictating activities in our homes in the hours that belong to families? An all-out ban on after-school assignments would be optimal. Short of that, we can at least sensibly agree on a cap limiting kids to a 40-hour workweek — and fewer hours for younger children.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Resistance even to this reasonable limit will be rife. Mike Miller, an English teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va., found this out firsthand when he spearheaded a homework committee to rethink the usual approach. He had read the education research and found a forgotten policy on the county books limiting homework to two hours a night, total, including all classes. “I thought it would be a slam dunk” to put the two-hour cap firmly in place, Miller said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But immediately, people started balking. “There was a lot of fear in the community,” Miller said. “It’s like jumping off a high dive with your kids’ future. If we reduce homework to two hours or less, is my kid really going to be okay?” In the end, the committee only agreed to a homework ban over school breaks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Miller’s response is a great model for us all. He decided to limit assignments in his own class to 20 minutes a night (the most allowed for a student with six classes to hit the two-hour max). His students didn’t suddenly fail. Their test scores remained stable. And they started using their more breathable schedule to do more creative, thoughtful work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That’s the way we will get to a sane work schedule for kids: by simultaneously pursuing changes big and small. Even as we collaboratively press for policy changes at the district or individual school level, all teachers can act now, as individuals, to ease the strain on overworked kids.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As parents and students, we can also organize to make homework the exception rather than the rule. We can insist that every family, teacher and student be allowed to opt out of assignments without penalty to make room for important activities, and we can seek changes that shift practice exercises and assignments into the actual school day.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We’ll know our work is done only when Zak and every other child can clock out, eat dinner, sleep well and stay healthy — the very things needed to engage and learn deeply. That’s the basic standard the law applies to working adults. Let’s do the same for our kids.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Vicki Abeles is the author of the bestseller </i><a href=# rel=noopener>Beyond Measure: Rescuing an Overscheduled, Overtested, Underestimated Generation,</a><i> and director and producer of the documentaries “</i><a href=# rel=noopener>Race to Nowhere</a><i>” and “</i><a href=# rel=noopener>Beyond Measure.</a><i>”</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2Rlf3qDjqGmpp2npL%2BsedKhpq6klGKvpnnBmqWnnZRis7O7zGaqnKCfpLm0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhomework-should-be-banned-from-schools.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhomework-should-be-banned-from-schools.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhomework-should-be-banned-from-schools.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhomework-should-be-banned-from-schools.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhomework-should-be-banned-from-schools.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhomework-should-be-banned-from-schools.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-riddles-that-can-make-you-scratch-your-brain-800883.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-riddles-that-can-make-you-scratch-your-brain-800883.html>15 Riddles That Can Make You Scratch Your Brain</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sncf-reseau-une-situation-financiere-jugee-preoccupante-par-la-cour-des-comptes.html>une situation financire juge &amp;quot;proccupante&amp;quot; par la Cour des comptes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sncf-reseau-une-situation-financiere-jugee-preoccupante-par-la-cour-des-comptes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
