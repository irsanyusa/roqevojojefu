But in House of the Dragon, two opposing sides of House Targaryen—each with their own team of dragons—are pitted against one another.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Set nearly 170 years <a href=#>before the events of Game of Thrones</a>, Season 2 of House of the Dragon chronicled the early days of the violent conflict known as the Dance of the Dragons, a war of succession that broke out between the ruling Targaryens. Following the death of King Viserys I Targaryen (played by Paddy Considine), the Iron Throne was contested by rival factions known as the Blacks—those who supported the claim of Viserys' eldest daughter, Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy)—and the Greens, those who backed her younger half-brother, Aegon II Targaryen (Tom Glynn-Carney). Following the Season 2 finale, showrunner and co-creator Ryan Condal said at a press conference that <a href=#>House of the Dragon will conclude after four seasons</a>, with production on Season 3 set to begin in early 2025.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The prequel spinoff series is based on George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire companion novel Fire & Blood, which details how the Targaryens destroyed themselves from the inside out by pitting dragonrider against dragonrider during the Dance, all but ensuring their House's eventual downfall. As Fire & Blood explains, "It is no easy thing for a man to be a dragonslayer. But dragons can kill dragons, and have."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here's what to know about how dragons work in the world of Westeros.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The dragons and their riders</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As things currently stand in House of the Dragon, the Blacks have seven dragonriders with dragons of combat age—Rhaenyra and her dragon, Syrax; her uncle-husband Daemon (Matt Smith) and his dragon, Caraxes; her son Jacaerys (Harry Collett) and his dragon, Vermax; Daemon's daughter Baela (Bethany Antonia) and her dragon, Moondancer; <a href=#>dragonseed Hugh (Kieran Bew) and his dragon, Vermithor</a>; <a href=#>dragonseed Ulf (Tom Bennett) and his dragon, Silverwing</a>; and <a href=#>dragonseed Addam (Clinton Liberty) and his dragon, Seasmoke</a>. Rhaenyra's younger son Joffrey (Oscar Eskinazi) is also bonded to a dragon, Tyraxes, but both are too young to fight. Additionally, Daemon’s younger daughter, Rhaena (Phoebe Campbell), is in the midst of a quest to claim the wild dragon known as Sheepstealer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the other side, the Greens have Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) and his dragon, Vhagar—the largest and arguably most powerful living dragon—his sister Helaena (Phia Saban) and her dragon, Dreamfyre—whom we’ve yet to see engage in the war—and his <a href=#>younger brother Daeron and his dragon, Tessarion</a>—who just took to wing. Aegon II has stated that his dragon, Sunfyre, <a href=#>died at the Battle of Rook’s Rest</a>, but that hasn’t been totally confirmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dragons-S2-Finale2.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The might of dragon power</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As legend goes, around 5,000 years before Aegon I Targaryen's conquest of Westeros, the Valyrian people of Essos first discovered dragons nesting in a chain of volcanoes on their peninsula. Using ancient blood magic, the Targaryens and other Valyrian dragonlords were then able to tame the dragons, mount them to fly, and harness their fire-breathing abilities.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thousands of years later, around a century after the Targaryens and their dragons relocated to Westeros in order to avoid the prophesied <a href=#>Doom of Valyria</a>, Aegon the Conquerer set his mind to unifying Westeros under his rule. He accomplished this thanks to the unrivaled might of the dragons bonded to him and his two sister-wives, Visenya and Rhaenys.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With dragons Balerion the Black Dread, Meraxes, and Vhagar—the same Vhagar that appears in House of the Dragon—at their disposal, the three Targaryen sibling-spouses conquered six of the Seven Kingdoms with relative ease (Dorne was spared). Aegon I then melted down the swords of his defeated enemies to forge the Iron Throne, establishing the Targaryen dynasty that would remain in power for nearly 300 years, right up until Aerys II "The Mad King" Targaryen was killed during Robert's Rebellion—the revolt that set in motion the events of Game of Thrones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/house-of-the-dragon_3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria and settle in Westeros, the Targaryens and their dragons were positioned to rule for as long as their House maintained a united front. But, following Aegon's conquest, it took little more than a century for the in-fighting of the Dance to kick off and dragons to start killing other dragons—beginning with <a href=#>Aemond and Vhagar murdering Rhaenyra's son Lucerys (Elliot Grihault) and his dragon, Arrax</a>. From that point on, the Targaryens' standing as the ruling house of Westeros was irrevocably weakened.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a Season 1 interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, Considine spoke about how Viserys, the final rider of Balerion before the Black Dread's death, may have been the last Targaryen royal to comprehend the true magnitude of the dragons.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I just think Viserys has an understanding of dragons," he said. "He actually sees them as very, very dangerous and a huge responsibility. He understands fully that it's these dragons that make the Targaryens powerful. He also has an understanding of their potential to destroy the world. He sees them as nuclear bombs in a way. I think [his younger brother] Daemon would happily ride on dragons and torch everything, whereas Viserys is very much like, 'You have to behave responsibly with these creatures that we have'—with these weapons, really."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>What to Remember About the War Between the Greens and Blacks Before House of the Dragon Season 2</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The nature of the dragon bond</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/eve-best_0.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sometime after their conquest of Westeros, House Targaryen made it common practice to place a dragon egg in the cradle of a newborn baby in the hopes that it would hatch and grow alongside its rider, strengthening their bond. However, that doesn't always pan out, as was evidenced in the first season by neither Aemond nor Rhaena having a dragon prior to Aemond claiming Vhagar.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Season 2, we learned that, in addition to the <a href=#>most pure-blooded Targaryens</a>, illegitimate children of Valryian dragonlord descent can also bond with dragons. These riders are called “dragonseed,” but there’s no real science behind how dragons decide who is worthy to be their mount and who isn’t.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I used to think I knew what it was to claim a dragon, but I understand now that what I thought I knew is ash in the wind,” Rhaenyra said in the season’s penultimate episode. “Perhaps it is blood. Or worth. Or perhaps it’s something else.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once a dragon bonds with a rider, that dragon won't let anyone else mount it alone while its rider is still living (although a dragon may allow another person on its back as long as its rider is also present). A new rider can only tame a dragon after its previous rider has died—as we saw Aemond do with Vhagar following the death of her previous rider, Laena Velaryon (Nanna Blondell). However, no rider, despite the strength of their bond, ever has full control over a dragon. As Viserys told a young Rhaenyra in the House of the Dragon series premiere, "The idea that we control the dragons is an illusion. They're a power man should never have trifled with. One that brought Valyria its doom. If we don't mind our own histories, it will do the same to us. Targaryen must understand this to be King...or Queen."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWhsf3N%2BjqGmrquVYrynedOhnGacopa0sLqMrJyaq5%2BjenN5w6uYoKeeqHqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-dragons-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-dragons-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-dragons-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-dragons-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-dragons-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhouse-of-the-dragon-season-2-dragons-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-does-danny-jacobs-actor-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-does-danny-jacobs-actor-html.html>How Much Money Does Danny Jacobs (Actor) Make?
