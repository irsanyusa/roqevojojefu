<time>11 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>German is a notoriously complex and difficult language to learn, at least compared to Western Europe’s other major languages. But it’s not impossible, as the roughly 130 million people who speak it as their native or second language can attest. If you’re wondering how to learn German fast, follow a handful of tried and true language-learning tips.&nbsp;</p><p>Following these tips will not make you magically absorb all of German’s (many) rules and nuances, but it will surely ease your learning. Just keep in mind that the best way to learn German is ultimately the one that best fits your learning style and level of motivation.</p><li><a href=#>Start from the German alphabet and its sounds</a></li><li><a href=#>Master the basics of German grammar and syntax</a></li><li><a href=#>Learn the most common vocabulary</a></li><li><a href=#>Surround yourself with German language</a></li><li><a href=#>Help your listening comprehension with music and podcasts</a></li><li><a href=#>Attend German classes with Lingoda</a></li><li><a href=#>Watch movies and videos in German</a></li><li><a href=#>Read German children’s books</a></li><li><a href=#>Leverage social media</a></li><li><a href=#>Put yourself out there and speak</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Start with Lingoda today</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Start-from-the-German-alphabet-and-its-sounds>1. Start from the German alphabet and its sounds</h2><p>How many letters are in the German alphabet? It seems like a simple question, but there are two schools of thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Some say there are 26, just like in the English alphabet. But others count four additional letters: ä, ö, ü (German umlauts) and ß (ligature). Whether or not you consider these four to be letters in their own right, you’ll need to master their sounds.</p><p>Here’s the good news: if you’re fluent in English, German sounds shouldn’t be too challenging, as most don’t differ much from their English counterparts. However, it’s important to familiarize yourself with long and short vowels, the particular sounds of umlauts and the various combinations of vowels and consonants (au, ei/ai, eu, pf, sch, etc.).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Master-the-basics-of-German-grammar-and-syntax>2. Master the basics of German grammar and syntax</h2><p>From multiple genders to verb positions, and from <a href=#>German grammar cases</a> to the innumerable word endings, get your basics down first. German grammar certainly comes with a lot of rules, but the upside is that there are relatively few exceptions to these rules. So, once the fundamentals are down, other more complex structures will fall into place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Learn-the-most-common-German-vocabulary>3. Learn the most common German vocabulary</h2><p>Jot down the most important words and phrases you want to remember, whether they be greetings, verbs or nouns. Expand this list each time you come across a new piece of vocabulary or an idiomatic expression. To keep things slightly more organized, you might want to create topic buckets and add any new word you learn to the appropriate category (if it’s a noun, don’t forget to include the article!).&nbsp;</p><p>This will help you become more comfortable with easy interactions. Trust us — it will only be a matter of time until you can build entire sentences and hold longer conversations.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Surround-yourself-with-German-language>4. Surround yourself with German language</h2><p>One of the secrets to learning German fast is immersion. The fuller, the better. Of course, taking a trip to a German-speaking country might not be affordable — and you may not feel ready to embark on such a journey, in any case. You can take advantage of a few free options, though!&nbsp;</p><p>Change your mobile phone’s main language to German and navigate your device in the new language. Or, cover your home appliances and furniture with Post-Its with the corresponding German nouns (and example sentences) written on them. You’ll naturally bump into them and passively absorb the terms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Help-your-listening-comprehension-with-music-and-podcasts>5. Help your listening comprehension with music and podcasts</h2><p>The most efficient learning occurs when you don’t realize it’s happening. This applies to learning a language, too. Listening to a song, a captivating story or a heartfelt conversation can have a much bigger impact than you may expect when learning German. So, add that German artist to your playlist and where lyrics aren’t too clear, try to translate them based on contextual clues. Create your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German-learning playlist</a> and sing your heart out.</p><p>Radio and podcasts are also useful tools to practice your listening skills. Leverage them to challenge your understanding of topics and points of view.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Attend-German-classes-with-Lingoda>6. Attend German classes with Lingoda</h2><p>While sitting down for hours in a class may not be something everyone enjoys, having a consistent routine and live feedback on your progress always helps. Schedules and location are no longer an issue with online classes, such as those offered by Lingoda. We made it possible for you to create the best-customized learning experience. Lingoda’s teachers’ body is varied and representative of all accents and variations to ensure your exposure to German is as comprehensive as possible. They are also based in different locations worldwide, making it easy to find the most convenient time for your class even when your agenda is packed.&nbsp;</p><p>With the smallest group sizes on the market, private lessons and the <a href=#>Language Sprint</a>, we pride ourselves on being the go-to solution for your language learning goals. Attending Lingoda’s German courses is one way you can give more structure to your language goals, practice in a safe space and obtain immediate personalized feedback on your performance. What are you waiting for?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start with Lingoda today</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Watch-movies-and-videos-in-German>7. Watch movies and videos in German</h2><p>Who doesn’t love a good movie? Or maybe you lean toward shorter formats, like YouTube. Regardless of your preferences, <a href=#>German movies and TV shows</a> are great tools for learning the language.&nbsp;</p><p>Most streaming platforms offer German subtitles, which can facilitate your overall comprehension and help expand your German vocabulary and cultural understanding. If you’re just starting out, pick a movie you’re already familiar with. This way, you can focus more on the dialogue and grammar, rather than on the plot itself.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Read-German-children’s-books>8. Read German children’s books</h2><p>Thanks to their highly accessible and relatively simple language, children’s books are a resource not to overlook. Their plots tend to be simpler, allowing you to focus on the grammatical structures and vocabulary. Children’s books can also help you better understand how certain language is used in context. They’re a nice trampoline for more complex readings, which you can tackle once your German skills improve.</p><p>With so many social connections happening online, social media and social networks are great tools to leverage for language learning. Discover new German-speaking creators and follow your favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>Far from a waste of time, social media offers a front-row seat to the everyday use of language — including many expressions and phrases you won’t find in academic books. As an added benefit, exposure to such content will also improve your understanding of cultural nuances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Put-yourself-out-there-and-speak>10. Put yourself out there and speak</h2><p>The ultimate goal of learning a language is communication. Hiccups will occur, especially at the very beginning of your journey. But don’t be afraid to make those mistakes! Errors propel you toward fluency — and the more you make, the more you’ll learn.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever the occasion allows for it, put yourself out there. Seek that linguistic discomfort that will teach you the most valuable lesson of all: in the end, it isn’t that scary. Try to order your beer and pretzel in German; ask for directions, even if you won’t fully understand the answer; tell a German friend how your day went, even if your adjective list boils down to “gut” and “schlecht.” Only uncomfortable practice will make you improve, but trust us when we say the reward is worth it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-secret-to-learning-german-is-out>The secret to learning German is out</h2><p>How to learn German will ultimately depend on your learning preferences. Whatever tips you decide to put into practice, bear in mind that language learning is a personal experience. So, do what feels right for you — read a book, binge that Netflix series (with German subtitles), tune in to your favorite podcast or sign up with Lingoda and attend their German courses – Just remember: the best way to learn German is the one that pushes you out of your comfort zone.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start with Lingoda today</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Valentina.jpg><h2>Valentina Rampazzo</h2><p><a href=#>Valentina Rampazzo</a> is an Italian Content Manager and writer.
