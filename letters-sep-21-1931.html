W. O. L.,” it is noted that you concluded the article with the statement “The Navy thanked Depression.” It is perfectly true that the Navy had only 45 deserters for the fiscal year 1931, but it attributes this record to “selective recruiting” rather than Depression. A deserter is the type of man who hasn’t the moral character to live up to his obligations and it cannot be expected of a man of this type to “look before he leaps.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Navy still employs gaudy posters and mans its recruiting stations with nattily dressed sailors—not to tempt the satisfied civilian but to inform him of the opportunities the Navy has to offer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Depression has little to do with recruiting, as “drifters” are not even considered by the Recruiting Officers. The requirements for enlistment in the Navy at the present time are higher than the entrance requirements in many colleges. A man must be a perfect physical specimen, produce four references from prominent men in his community, have a clear police record and pass a general classification test with a minimum mark of 75%. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">J.

Bonfils of the Denver Post and glorified in that exaggerating sheet, was a tame trout named Elmer “known to hundreds of visitors to the Miller preserve, from whom he would accept remnants of lunch, coming half out of the water to eat out of their hands. A friendly and sociable trout was Elmer and he did tricks for the tourists including a watery rendition of ‘Sweet Adeline’ when his crumbs were soaked in the drippings of the picnic flask.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Then came Bonfils wading in the pool and as the trusting Elmer, thinking him a friend, rubbed his scaly sides against the boots of the fisherman, purring happily, he was seized roughly by the gills and thrown ashore.”—ED.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cathedral</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Referring to your caption “Flesh Cathedral” in the Sept. 7 issue, description of Mr. Earl Carroll’s new playhouse in New York, permit an original subscriber to your always interesting weekly to send the following comment:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The word “cathedral” is a misnomer. when applied to any building, however costly or impressive, that is not associated with an offering of worship and service to Almighty God.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Strictly speaking (and according to Webster’s New International Dictionary) a cathedral is the church which contains the cathedra or Bishop’s official chair or throne, and which is, therefore, the principal church in a diocese, as St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Bishop’s chair to be placed some day in the completed Sanctuary of Washington Cathedral is known as the “Glastonbury Cathedra” because it is made of stones from the ancient church erected at Glastonbury Abbey in the 6th Century. Mr. Stanley Austin, the donor of these historic stones, wished them to serve as a witness to the continuity of the Christian Church. . . .</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">EDWIN N.

Yet in it is that which might approximate a Bishop’s Chair. First Box on the audience’s right in the auditorium is the Official Box, reserved for great and busy dignitaries who may want to inspect Mr. Carroll’s girl spectacle yet not be out of touch with their business affairs. Off the Official Box is a Conference Room, equipped with a soundproof plate glass telephone booth. From the Box through double, automatic, fireproof doors the stage can be reached. When not occupied by notables, seats in the Official Box are sold to the general public at $3 each. Last week officials of U. S. Steel Corp., American Tobacco Co. and Standard Oil Co. of New York bought the Official Box. John Davison Rockefeller Jr. declined an offer of it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are also two backstage boxes, one on each side, reserved for friends of the cast and Showman Carroll’s favorite visitors.—ED.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All Things</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sirs:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Your slogan “TIME brings all things” was amusingly proven to me this summer when my sister and I were driving through an old Georgia city.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To our astonishment we found nearly every street unmarked, and as we wished to pay a short visit to relatives there, we were quite disappointed.

A small green frog and a 24-inch long snake, both captured in the environs of the lake, were placed on the ground facing each other, few inches apart. After a few minutes of staring at each other, the frog was struck at, seized and gradually swallowed by the snake, forming a slowly moving lump in the forepart of the snake. A tickling of the snake’s underside, just behind the lump would cause the snake to “throw up” the frog, apparently unharmed from his experience, and the frog could hop away, provided we did not wait too long before tickling the snake. True, his green coat would be bleached out a little. When we waited too long to tickle the snake, the frog would be disengorged in a lifeless, bleached out condition.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perhaps those were Jonah Frogs and Whale Snakes we played with.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">VICTOR L.
