She will return to official duties when cleared to do so by her medical team.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The news followed an announcement in February that Kate’s father-in-law, King Charles III, was <a href=#>also diagnosed with cancer</a> and would be postponing public-facing duties as he received treatment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Easter, which <a href=#>typically sees</a> the extended royal family gather at Windsor Castle, was a scaled back celebration this year. Kate, her husband Prince William, and their three children—George, Charlotte, and Louis—were not in attendance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kate’s announcement revealing her cancer diagnosis—which royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams calls “perhaps the most courageous broadcast made on health matters ever by a public figure in Britain”—changes the Easter holiday “enormously.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s a deeply sobering experience for all of us,” he tells TIME in a phone call.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In years past, Easter was a relatively low-key holiday in comparison to Christmas, Fitzwilliams says, but that was tipped to be different this Easter in the wake of a turbulent period that has transfixed the world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The international attention will be enormous and that’s never happened before,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what you need to know about the royal's family's Easter traditions and the 2024 festivities.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What are the royal family’s Easter traditions?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Easter weekend festivities begin on Maundy Thursday, the final Thursday before Easter Sunday. The tradition on this day, which dates back centuries, is for the reigning King or Queen to attend a church service and give out “Maundy money” to local people.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Early in her reign, Queen Elizabeth II began traveling to cathedrals and abbeys outside of London to distribute the gifts around the country. Fitzwilliams says the late Queen was “very fond” of the Maundy Thursday service.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Each recipient receives two small leather purses—one containing a small amount of ordinary coins and the second containing Maundy coins up to the value of the sovereign’s age. Although legal tender, <a href=#>the coins are often kept as keepsakes</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">King Charles <a href=#>continued the tradition</a> last year, having <a href=#>already filled in</a> for his mother’s duties in 2022 before her death. The King’s wife of 19 years, Queen Camilla, attended Thursday’s <a href=#>service at Worcester Cathedral</a> in his stead this year, but the King <a href=#>recorded an audio message</a> that was broadcast during the service.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the message, the King stressed the theme of service to others, saying that we “need and benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to us, especially in a time of need,” and reiterated his coronation pledge “to follow Christ’s example—not to be served but to serve.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It wasn’t the first recorded message from a royal on Easter, although it has not been an annual tradition. Then-Prince Charles <a href=#>released a televised message</a> on Easter 2018 and his mother <a href=#>recorded her first-ever Easter message</a> in 2020 near the start of the pandemic.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Thursday’s event, Worcester Cathedral Flower Guild also crafted Maundy Service nosegays—sustainable, locally sourced flower arrangements—for children to present to Queen Camilla, an annual tradition that dates back to 600 A.D., according to the royal family’s<a href=#> X (formerly Twitter)</a> account.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Over the Easter weekend, the extended royal family traditionally gathers at Windsor.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When we’d pull into Windsor Castle for Easter court, it was always fun and exciting,” Darren McGrady, who was personal chef to the royal family from 1982 to 1993 and then for Princess Diana until her death in 1997, tells TIME in a phone call.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Good Friday, chefs made hot cross buns, which they would send up for afternoon tea, says McGrady, who now runs a <a href=#>catering business in the U.S.</a> The tradition continued as of 2022, when royal pastry chefs <a href=#>shared a social media video</a> of making hot cross buns on Good Friday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Christians <a href=#>traditionally eat fish</a> instead of meat on Good Friday, so as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the late Queen then <a href=#>enjoyed a hake fish supper</a>, McGrady says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Easter Sunday, the royal family traditionally <a href=#>walks to a church service </a>at St George’s Chapel, a 14th century building on the castle grounds. The walk is about 10 minutes downhill, and in past years, they often took a car back up as it is a steep climb, McGrady says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Easter lunch after church in the monarchy’s “heyday” involved 20 or 30 royals around the table, McGrady says. The menu was “nearly always lamb,” such as a roast leg of lamb with red currant jelly.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That was followed by afternoon tea, accompanied by a “huge selection” of decorated chocolate eggs. In one of McGrady’s favorite Easter memories at Windsor Castle, the former royal chef put a clock and sugar mouse on a chocolate Easter egg, inspired by the nursery rhyme “Hickory Dickory Dock,” and sent it up to the nursery. The footman brought it back down with the head bitten off the mouse—Prince William, around seven years old, had reportedly taken off a chunk.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">McGrady says Queen Elizabeth II was a “chocoholic” with a penchant for dark chocolate, something she would give up during her Lent fast and looked forward to enjoying on Easter, but “King Charles, however, is not a huge fan of chocolate at all.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Otherwise, McGrady says the King enjoyed the traditional Easter menu, as the monarch likes fish and “absolutely adores” lamb. Royal expert Ingrid Seward<a href=#> told The Sun</a> last year that Easter traditions would carry on after his mother’s death: "Charles is a traditionalist, so I am sure he will do things as they have always been done since he was a child.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>What happened at the royal Easter Sunday 2024 service?</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The King and Queen attended the Easter Sunday church service at Windsor. Following the service, they were <a href=#>seen greeting visitors</a>, shaking their hands and exchanging well-wishes.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ahead of Easter, Fitzwilliams called King Charles’ expected attendance “very good news” and “very significant."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kate, William, and their children, however, did not attend church on Easter Sunday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The family has <a href=#>lived since 2022</a> at Adelaide Cottage on the Windsor estate. Kate’s video announcement of her cancer diagnosis was filmed at Windsor on March 20 and released on March 22. It has been <a href=#>reported</a> the couple traveled after that announcement to Anmer Hall, a royal residence in Norfolk.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kensington Palace declined to comment on where the family spends their private time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With Kate and William absent, and William’s brother Prince Harry, his wife Meghan Markle, and their two children in California, the Easter gathering was smaller than usual.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The King and his wife, Queen Camilla, were joined by the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh—Prince Edward and Sophie—and their son, James, Earl of Wessex, along with the King’s sister, Princess Anne, who was joined by her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence. Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, were also in attendance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The pared-back celebration is a reflection of the private battles the family is facing, experts noted. According to McGrady: “I think it will be a quiet time for the King, and that’s probably a good thing as he’s battling his cancer. Easter will be more of a time of reflection than a happy family get-together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWZlhnh%2BjqumspmcYrOiucilsGadkajBpr6MramanJmptrC60maioqaXYrCprdGlnKxlm5bBpnnMopudpJWpvK97</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froyal-family-easter-traditions-king-charles-kate-middleton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2froyal-family-easter-traditions-king-charles-kate-middleton.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2froyal-family-easter-traditions-king-charles-kate-middleton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2froyal-family-easter-traditions-king-charles-kate-middleton.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froyal-family-easter-traditions-king-charles-kate-middleton.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2froyal-family-easter-traditions-king-charles-kate-middleton.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./congres-des-maires-renovation-urbaine-les-elus-plebiscitent-lanru-pour-ses-20-ans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./congres-des-maires-renovation-urbaine-les-elus-plebiscitent-lanru-pour-ses-20-ans.html>les lus plbiscitent l'Anru pour ses 20 ans</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./louvre-lens-un-apres-vers-un-effet-bilbao.html>vers un effet Bilbao ?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./louvre-lens-un-apres-vers-un-effet-bilbao.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
