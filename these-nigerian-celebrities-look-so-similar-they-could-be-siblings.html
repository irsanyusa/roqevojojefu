But if you're someone who believes that <a href=# id=3398215c-3048-4b98-aba6-551c6827c68e data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>everyone has a lookalike out there</a>, then you're going to want to check out these pairs of Nigerian celebrities who bear a striking resemblance to each other.</p><p>In fact, they look so much alike that they could easily be mistaken for siblings. Whether you're a fan of these celebrities or not, you can't deny that their lookalike status is seriously impressive.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So, without further ado, let's dive into the world of Nigerian celebrity doppelgangers!</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>1.

Some have even gone as far as to say they could be long-lost siblings!</p><p>The topic of their resemblance was so controversial in 2021 that many Nigerians were convinced they were related. But while they may share a similar appearance, their music couldn't be more different — Starr's sound is more Afro-Pop, while Tems' is Alté and R&B.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Nonetheless, Starr was thrilled to be compared to Tems at the start of her career, and she felt privileged for her sound and features to be compared with such an accomplished artist.</p><p>Whether they're related or not, Starr and Tems' resemblance is truly remarkable. Who knows, maybe one day we'll see these two collaborate on a song and blow our minds with their combined talent!</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>2.
