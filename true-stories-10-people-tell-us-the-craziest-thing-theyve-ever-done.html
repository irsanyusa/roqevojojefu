He denied knowing me." - <strong>Martha</strong></p><p>"There was this girl I liked in school, and to be honest, she wasn't much good for me except with the sex. My final exams were in two weeks and I swear I wasn't ready. But just so I could get sex, I took out my time to teach her. Every single day, she'd call me, I'd buy her food, teach her, and we'd have sex. Then a few days to exams, I started to think about my life and the school fees my parents paid, running into hundreds of thousands. That day she called me and I was like, "nah sis, it's time for me to read for myself".</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I managed to pass. She failed." - <strong>Wale</strong></p><p>"My friend was writing a carryover and I had helped her re-write. It could have gotten me expelled" - <strong>Juilet</strong></p><p>"Gave a girl I didn't know my ATM card because she was left stranded by a guy she came to see. Meanwhile a night before that day she was forming for me. She left with the ATM and my pin and two months later I had to send someone who travelled to that state to collect my card from her" - <strong>Trinity</strong></p><p>"I escorted a lady from Oshodi through Charlie Boy to Gbagada because there was no bus (almost 2-hour walk) and I live at Mushin. I had to walk back home alone because there was no bus! (Another 2 hours)" - <strong>Toni</strong></p><p>"Okay, I didn't do crazy stuff for him. I did to him. I poured Super Glue into my brother's charging port because he flogged me." - <strong>Dami</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I escorted a chick to her house and took about an hour's walk back home in the rain" - <strong>David</strong></p><p>A man attacked me and my sister. He actually tried to molest us and we were like teenagers. So we overpowered him and threw him down a well. We don't know what happen to him after. - <strong>Shola</strong></p><p>"My friend lost all his receipts and he needed it not only for clearance, but to show his parents. So we forged all the receipts. It was like 98% perfect." - <strong>Demola</strong></p><p>"I was headed for Makurdi and I was completely stranded in Abuja around 9pm. So I walked up to a complete stranger, he helped me find a small hotel on the outskirts of Abuja, took me to his house where he lived in one room with his wife and son. He shared his dinner with me. Then he escorted me back to my hotel. The next morning, he told me where to get a bus. Called me when I got to Makurdi to make sure I was safe. I never heard from him ever again. That day, my faith in humanity was renewed." - <strong>Lekan</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02inqKhdmMKtwNSrnGisoqqybr%2FTqKminaNifnF5z56mqaSVYsGmuMtmrKxlpJ2ybq%2FRmrGinaOperW0yKeeZqyYmsa3sYyerZ6qXZm8r7GOqpxtnmCcvQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrue-stories-10-people-tell-us-the-craziest-thing-theyve-ever-done.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftrue-stories-10-people-tell-us-the-craziest-thing-theyve-ever-done.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftrue-stories-10-people-tell-us-the-craziest-thing-theyve-ever-done.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftrue-stories-10-people-tell-us-the-craziest-thing-theyve-ever-done.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrue-stories-10-people-tell-us-the-craziest-thing-theyve-ever-done.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrue-stories-10-people-tell-us-the-craziest-thing-theyve-ever-done.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./popsi-la-journee-des-politiques-sociales-innovantes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./popsi-la-journee-des-politiques-sociales-innovantes.html>11-2022 | POPSI !
