<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/soul-mates-marriage.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Given that you have 500,000,000 potential soul mates,” writes Randall Munroe, in the science book <a href=#>What If?</a>, “you’ll only find true love in one lifetime out of ten thousand.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A cousin of mine gave a wedding toasts along these lines at his brother’s wedding: He <a href=#>calculated the odds</a> of ever finding the one person “meant for you,” given the billions of people on the planet, the number of people you’re likely to meet in the course of your life, and the fact that in the scheme of human history, none of us stays in a corporeal body for very long. The toast concluded: “So I think the odds are against your being soul mates, but that doesn’t make it less of a miracle that you found each other.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the soul mate ideal just won’t go away. You see it invoked in dating profiles, rom-coms, and <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The concept dates back at least to Plato’s Symposium. Zeus, seeking to humble humans, split us in half, forcing us to wander in search of our other half: “So ancient is the desire of one another which is implanted in us, reuniting our original nature, making one of two, and healing the state of man.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While romantic, this has done an awful lot of damage — creating impossible-to-meet expectations, making people think that a happy, healthy relationship isn’t good enough, tricking people into holding out for “the one.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’ve experienced that feeling of love at first sight that signifies encountering one’s soulmate. It was magical, and then, quite quickly, dissolved by the sobering light of day, by the pressures of real life. If that man was my soul mate, soul mates are overrated.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My favorite writer on the subject of the soul mates is J.R.R. <a href=#>Tolkien</a>, who was married to his wife, Edith, from her teens until her death at age 82. He acknowledged that soul mates are pretty good in theory: “In such great inevitable love, often love at first sight, we catch a vision, I suppose, of marriage as it should have been in an unfallen world.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a letter to his son, he presented a far more nuanced and compelling approach to what a real “soul mate” is. Was there someone out there theoretically better suited to him than Edith? Probably. But so what?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Only a very wise man at the end of his life could make a sound judgment concerning whom, amongst the total possible chances, he ought most profitably to have married,” Tolkien wrote. “Nearly all marriages, even happy ones, are mistakes: in the sense that almost certainly (in a more perfect world, or even with a little more care in this very imperfect one) both partners might have found more suitable mates.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tolkien blamed our “soul mates” obsession on the Romantic chivalric tradition: “Its weakness is, of course, that it began as an artificial courtly game, a way of enjoying love for its own sake. . . . It takes, or at any rate has in the past taken, the young man’s eye off women as they are” — that is, “companions in shipwreck not guiding stars.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I love that: companions in shipwreck. True soul mates are made, not born. This tracks with what I see in long marriages. It took time for many of even the most loving couples to feel like kindred spirits. It wasn’t something that happened in the first hour, or even in the first year. It took time, and patience, and commitment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He’s very efficient,” one woman I know said, looking at her husband with so much affection, I felt like I was intruding. “And I procrastinate. We used to fight about it all the time, but now we just work around each other. He lets me sit there and drink coffee in the morning while he bustles around. When we’re on vacation, we spend one day the way he wants to—usually getting up early and driving to every bakery in town — and the next day the way I want to—sleeping in, strolling. We take care of each other. But we had to learn that, how to sync up.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another friend told me that his tradition-minded parents, an adorable couple who would appear to the outside world like soul mates, didn’t have much binding them together when they married: “She was Jewish, and he had a good job; that was enough.” They struggled while their kids were growing up, resolving to stay together until the nest was empty and then go their separate ways. But something funny happened: by the time the children were grown, neither wanted to leave.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Our old notion of soul mates is not helpful. “The ‘real soul-mate,’” Tolkien wrote, “is the one you are actually married to.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Calhoun is the author of <a href=# rel=noopener>Wedding Toasts I’ll Never Give</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2duhXeEjrCfmqxdrry2edKhpq6klGKxsHnIp6qtnZGZerCyjLCYoqyZo7Russ6rZJplo6TCrbnArZxo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-you-should-do-instead-of-waiting-for-a-soulmate.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-you-should-do-instead-of-waiting-for-a-soulmate.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-you-should-do-instead-of-waiting-for-a-soulmate.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-you-should-do-instead-of-waiting-for-a-soulmate.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-you-should-do-instead-of-waiting-for-a-soulmate.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-you-should-do-instead-of-waiting-for-a-soulmate.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./december-global-holidays-christmas-hanukkah-yule.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./december-global-holidays-christmas-hanukkah-yule.html>11 Holidays the World Celebrates in December</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1494625-tiwa-savages-scope-reactions-ayra-starr-explains-meaning-popular-line-e-dey-rush-song.html>Tiwa Savages Scope: Reactions As Ayra Starr Explains the Meaning of Popular Line E Dey R</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1494625-tiwa-savages-scope-reactions-ayra-starr-explains-meaning-popular-line-e-dey-rush-song.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
